<!-- Very simple XML file with parameters for mcc172 hat board, -->
<!-- only supports one level of tags, -->
<!-- and the file is meant to be very short. -->
<!-- The number of characters in the file, less comments, -->
<!-- has to be less than MAX_FILE_SIZE which is set to 2000. -->
<!-- The file will only be processed up to MAX_FILE_SIZE Charaters, -->
<!-- the remaining characters will be ignored. -->

<!-- The tag values can be changed at any time and the program re-run -->

<!-- ** NOTE:-  ** -->
<!-- All values except the options parameter have to be greater than zero -->
<!-- Comments cannot span multiple lines -->


<!--  ***** PARAMETERS ***** -->

<!-- The options parameter is set to 0 for default operation, which is:-
<!-- scaled; calibrated data; no trigger; and finite operation. -->
<!-- Currently the only option supported is default. -->
<options>0</options>


<!-- This is also referred to as the "sampling rate per channel" -->
<!-- The MCC 172 can generate an ADC sampling clock equal to -->
<!-- 51.2 kHz divided by an integer between 1 and 256. -->
<!-- The data_rate_per_channel will be internally converted
<!-- to the nearest valid rate. -->
<scan_rate> 10240.0</scan_rate>


<!-- For "finite mode" the buffer size will be allocated as the
<!-- total number of samples in the scan.
<!-- Specifying a very large value for samples_per_channel -->
<!-- could use too much of the Raspberry Pi memory. -->
<!-- If the memory allocation fails, the function will return -->
<!-- [RESULT_RESOURCE_UNAVAIL]. The allocation could succeed, -->
<!-- but the lack of free memory could cause other -->
<!-- problems in the Raspberry Pi. -->  
<samples_per_channel>1024.00</samples_per_channel>

<!-- software only supports from 1 to 2 channels-->
<number_of_channels>2</number_of_channels>

<!-- Default sensitivity is 1000.0 mv/unit -->
<!-- Examples, a sensor with a sensitivity of 10 V/g. -->
<!-- Set the sensitivity to 10,000, the returned data will be in units of g.-->
<!-- A vibration sensor with a sensitivity of 100 mV/g.-->
<!-- Set the sensitivity to 100, the returned data will be in units of g. -->
<sensitivity>100.0</sensitivity>

<!-- IEPE power supply is either on or off -->
<iepe_supply>on</iepe_supply>
