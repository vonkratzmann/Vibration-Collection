Setup Remote Access to the Raspberry Pi

This assume the Raspberry Pi will operate in a headless mode ie no display or keyboard.

This setup is designed to be done remotely, but in order to access the Raspberry Pi 
remotely set up SSH to allow remote access to the raspberry pi command line.

The Raspberry Pi OS has the SSH server disabled by default. It can be enabled manually 
from the command line:

1. sudo raspi-config in a terminal window
2. Select Interfacing Options
3. Navigate to and select SSH
4. Choose Yes
5. Select Ok
6. Choose Finish

For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named ssh, 
without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card from another computer. 
When the Pi boots, it looks for the ssh file. If it is found, SSH is enabled and the file is deleted. 
The content of the file does not matter; it could contain text, or nothing at all.

If you have loaded Raspberry Pi OS onto a blank SD card, you will have two partitions. 
The first one, which is the smaller one, is the boot partition. Place the file into this one.

To run the client on windows 10, 
go to Settings > Apps > Apps & features > Manage optional features > Add a feature, 
and choose to install OpenSSH Client.

To test the connection from the windows computer to the Raspberry Pi: 

  ssh pi@<IP>

replacing the default pi user with your username and IP with the IP address of the Raspberry Pi, 
  e.g. ssh eben@192.168.1.5

Next you will be prompted for the password for the Raspberry Pi.
You should now be able to see the Raspberry Pi prompt:

  pi@raspberrypi ~ $

Exit so the next steps can be done on the computer


Transfer Setup and Configuration Files to the Raspberry Pi

On a Dos window on the windows PC, using SCP (Secure Copy) 
copy the configuration files form the windows computer to the Raspberry Pi, but first
create the directory on the raspberry Pi:

  ssh pi@<IP> "mkdir -p ~/configuration/"

then copy the file to the computer:

  scp -rp <source directory>/configuration pi@<IP>:~/configuration/

  e.g. scp -rp mcc172/config.* ben@192.168.1.5:configuration/


Run Setup on Raspberry 

Run the set up file which will:
 - config the Raspberry Pi
 - setup the cron job to gather the vibration data at the specified frquency
 - setup the cron job to transfer the vibration data to the PC

Now periodically monitor the files and error log files to make sure the vibration data gathering 
program is working and the files are being transferrd to the PC
